This repository contains my solutions to problems from various programming competitions (so far mainly from the Polish Olympiad in Informatics and Codeforeces).

## My goal

This repository was created for two purposes: first, as my *personal* notebook and diary, and second, to help people who want to really *understand* the code of some solution. For this reason, I sometimes value clarity of the code above slight improvements in performance and memory consumption. This is also why I don't use *templates* in the form of a few dozen initial lines. Instead, sometimes I use one or two `#define` directives, when it is particularly convenient.

At the same time, let's remember that this is competitive programming, though. I will never follow the rules of proper code writing when files are usually short and I often have little time to write them.
