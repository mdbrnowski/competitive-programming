This repository contains my solutions to problems from various programming competitions.

## My goal

This repository was created for two purposes: first, as my *personal* notebook and diary, and second, to help people who want to really *understand* the code of a solution. For this reason, I sometimes value clarity of the code above slight improvements in performance and memory consumption. This is also why I don't use *templates* in the form of a few dozen initial lines. Instead, sometimes I use one or two `#define` directives, when it is particularly convenient.

Compilation flags:

```shell
export CXXFLAGS="-Wall -Wshadow -g -D_GLIBCXX_DEBUG -D_GLIBCXX_DEBUG_PEDANTIC"
```
